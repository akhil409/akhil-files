          <p> <span style="font-size: large;"> Putin studied law at Leningrad State University</span>, where his tutor was Anatoly Sobchak, 
              later one of the leading reform politicians of the perestroika period.  <br><br>
              Putin served 15 years as a foreign intelligence officer for the KGB (Committee for State Security),
               including six years in Dresden, East Germany. <br/>
               Although he was virtually unknown, Putin’s public-approval ratings soared when he launched a well-organized military operation against secessionist rebels in Chechnya. 
               <br/> <br/>Wearied by years of Yeltsin’s erratic behaviour, the Russian public appreciated Putin’s coolness and decisiveness under pressure. Putin’s support for a new electoral bloc, Unity, ensured its success in the December parliamentary elections.
               <br/> <br/>  In 1990 he retired from active KGB service with the rank of lieutenant colonel and returned to Russia to become prorector of Leningrad State University with responsibility for the institution’s external relations. </p>
